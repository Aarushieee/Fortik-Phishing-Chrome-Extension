# Privacy Policy — SafeGuard - Malicious Site Detector

Effective date: 2025-10-30

SafeGuard operates with privacy by default. This policy explains what data is processed and how.

## Data we process
- Local analysis: By default, all detection heuristics run locally in your browser. No browsing data is transmitted to our servers.
- Optional API checks: If you enable API checks and configure an endpoint, the current page URL is sent to that endpoint for risk assessment. Authentication headers you configure are sent only to that endpoint.

## Storage
- We use `chrome.storage.local` to store your preferences (protection on/off, sensitivity) and a small rolling history of detections for your reference. This data remains on your device.

## What we do not do
- We do not sell your data.
- We do not use or share personal information for advertising purposes.

## Security
We follow best practices for extension permissions (minimal set), and never request more access than required for core functionality.
